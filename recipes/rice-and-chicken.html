    <h1>Method:</h1>
    <h2>Prepare Rice:</h2>
    <p>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
    </p>
    <p>In a separate pot, bring 2 cups of chicken broth to a boil.
    </p>
    <p>Add the rinsed rice to the boiling broth, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes or
      until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.
    </p>
    <h2>Cook Chicken:
    </h2>
    <p>Season the chicken pieces with salt, pepper, oregano, cumin, and paprika.
    </p>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.
    </p>
    <p>Add the seasoned chicken and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through. This usually takes about 5-7
      minutes.
    </p>
    <h2>Saute Vegetables:

    </h2>
    <p>Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, and diced bell pepper to the skillet. Saute until the vegetables are
      softened.
    </p>
    <h2>Combine Ingredients:

    </h2>
    <p>Stir in the cooked rice and diced tomatoes into the skillet with the chicken and vegetables. Mix well to combine.
    </p>
    <h2>Finish and Serve:

    </h2>
    <p>Adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper if needed.
    </p>
    <p>Garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro if desired.
