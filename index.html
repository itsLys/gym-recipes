    <h1>Nutrition</h1>
    <p>Nutrition is the fundamental science of how our bodies obtain and use the essential components found in the foods
      we consume.</p>
    <p>There are three primary <strong>macronutrients</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Protiens are essential for building and repairing not only muscle, but all other
        tissues in the body, and they are found in sources like meat, fish, eggs and others.</li>
      <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Often referred to as Carbs, are the body's primary energy source, there are
        simple carbs which are found in fruits and sugars, and complex carbs which are found in grains and vegetables.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Fats:</strong> Fats play a crucial role in hormone production and the absorption of fat-soluble
        vitamins. Sources like avocados, olive oil, and fatty fish contribute to a balanced intake.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Balancing these macronutrients in your dient is essential for muscle building, loosing fat, and overall health.
    </p>

    <h1>Meal Preparations</h1>

    <h2>Calories</h2>
    <p>When we consume something, our bodies translate some of that food into energy, which we call calories, so we
      measure the amount of food we take as how many calories does that food have </p>
    <p>Each macronutrient provide some energy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Proteins and Carbs have 4 calories per gram. </li>
      <li>Fats are more energy dense, offering about 9 calories per gram.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may have noticed that fats provide more energy, but our bodies tend to use carbs more efficiently quickly,
      that's why carbs should be our primary source of quick energy, doesn't mean that you don't eat any fat, they are
      still an important part of our diets.</p>
    <p>You should always have a food goal for the day, which basically means you should have a number of calories,
      proteins, carbs and fats that you aim to take per day, there are a lot of websites that give you an estimation on
      how much you need based on your goals, weight, height, age etc.</p>
    <p>A general rule of thumb is to focus on the protein intake, and balance the other two (carbs and fats), and all of
      the food that you eat in the day should amount to the calories that you need.</p>
    <p>Protein intake should be about 1.2 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight.</p>
    <p>You should aim for 300-500 calories above your maintenance level if you're bulking, and you should aim for
      300-500 calories below your maintenance level if you're cutting.</p>

    <h2>Bulking and Cutting</h2>
    <p>When you're not trying to reach any fitness goal, you're most likely eating just the right amount for your body
      to stay the weight it is right now, our bodies have a mechanism in which it tells you to eat or stop eating for
      that wight to stay maintained, and the mechanisms are hunger and fullness.</p>
    <p>When maintaining, each day, you eat just about the right amount of calories to stay the weight you are in. this
      phase is called maintenance, and the amount of calories you eat are called, maintenance calories.</p>
    <p>But in order to reach a fitness goal, say gaining muscle or loosing fat, you need to undergo bulking or cutting.
    </p>
    <p>Bulking and cutting are the phases you go through to reach your goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Bulking (Muscle Building):</b> It's the eat-more, lift-heavy phase. You're in a calorie surplus (eating
        more calories then maintenance calories) aiming to
        gain muscle. Think of it as the growth spurt for your muscles. Eat well, lift hard, and watch those gains.
      </li>
      <li><b>Cutting (Fat Loss):</b> Time to trim the excess. You're in a calorie deficit, shedding fat while preserving
        the muscle you gained during bulking. Picture it as sculpting and revealing the hard work underneath by dropping
        the body fat.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's a cycle, not a one-time deal. Bulk when you want to grow, cut when you want to define. Just remember, both
      need a combo of smart eating, solid workouts, and patience.</p>
    <p>Remember, if you're not careful, your bulk could be building more fluff than muscle, also when cutting, if you go
      all in and tried to cut a huge amount of calories, you might end up loosing muscle.</p>
    <p>Keep it steady, progressivly bulk and cut, train hard, and find a balance.</p>

    <h2>Preparing the food</h2>
    <p>Meal prep is not just about cooking, it's about planning,weighing, and optimizing my meals.
    <p>
      Weighing food ensures
      that you hit your target calories and macros precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timing matters too (although not for beginners) you should
      focus on consuming more around workouts for energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preparing meals in advance is a game-changer. I invest
      time upfront, cooking for the week. This not only saves me from last-minute stress but also guarantees that my
      busy weekdays are energized and fuled with nutritious, goal-oriented eats. It's the ultimate strategy for a
      streamlined, efficient approach to eating well.
    </p>
    <h1>Easy and Simple Recipes</h1>
    <p>Finally, let's get cooking.</p>
    <p>When clean eating, there are as many healthy choices as there are unhealthy ones, but I'm too lazy to even think
      about what I'm going to eat, so I trim my choices to few simple ingredients that I eat most of the time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Chicken:</b> A lean protein powerhouse, versatile and easy to cook.</li>
      <li>Fish: Packed with protein and omega-3 fatty acids, supporting both muscle growth and overall health.
      </li>
      <li><b>Rice:</b> A staple carbohydrate source, providing energy for workouts and aiding in recovery.

      </li>
      <li><b>Potatoes:</b> Nutrient-dense with complex carbs, perfect for sustained energy and muscle glycogen
        replenishment.

      </li>
      <li><b>Eggs:</b> A convenient source of high-quality protein and various essential nutrients.

      </li>

        well-being.

        well-being. Don't forget to include a colorful array â€“ they add flavor, texture, and vital nutrients to your
        meals. Remember, our bodies crave that fiber.</li>
