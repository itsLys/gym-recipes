    <h1>Nutrition</h1>
    <p>Nutrition is the fundamental science of how our bodies obtain and use the essential components found in the foods
      we consume.</p>
    <p>There are three primary <strong>macronutrients</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Protiens are essential for building and repairing not only muscle, but all other
        tissues in the body, and they are found in sources like meat, fish, eggs and others.</li>
      <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Often referred to as Carbs, are the body's primary energy source, there are
        simple carbs which are found in fruits and sugars, and complex carbs which are found in grains and vegetables.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Fats:</strong> Fats play a crucial role in hormone production and the absorption of fat-soluble
        vitamins. Sources like avocados, olive oil, and fatty fish contribute to a balanced intake.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Balancing these macronutrients in your dient is essential for muscle building, loosing fat, and overall health.
    </p>
    <h1>Meal Preparations</h1>
    <p>When we consume something, our bodies translate some of that food into energy, which we call calories, so we
      measure the amount of food we take as how many calories does that food have </p>
    <p>Each macronutrient provide some energy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Proteins and Carbs have 4 calories per gram. </li>
      <li>Fats are more energy dense, offering about 9 calories per gram.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may have noticed that fats provide more energy, but our bodies tend to use carbs more efficiently quickly,
      that's why carbs should be our primary source of quick energy, doesn't mean that you don't eat any fat, they are
      still an important part of our diets.</p>
    <p>You should always have a food goal for the day, which basically means you should have a number of calories,
      proteins, carbs and fats that you aim to take per day, there are a lot of websites that give you an estimation on
      how much you need based on your goals, weight, height, age etc.</p>
    <p>A general rule of thumb is to focus on the protein intake, and balance the other two (carbs and fats), and all of
      the food that you eat in the day should amount to the calories that you need.</p>
    <p>Protein intake should be about 1.2 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight.</p>
    <p>You should aim for 300-500 calories above your maintenance level if you're bulking <!-- Link to articles -->, and
      you should aim for 300-500 calories below your maintenance level if you're cutting.</p>
